Hi, there!

My name is Genoveva and I'm taking a loooot of steps to become the best Web Designer/Developer I can be. I'm currently trying to learn a lot more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in the past I took a computer programmer course where I learned multiple programming languages, such as C#, PHP, SQL, JAVA, PYTHON, among others.
